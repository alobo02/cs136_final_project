\section{Team}

\textbf{Team Members:} Nate Davis and Alexander Lobo

\section{Dataset}

\subsection{Dataset Access}

\textbf{Access:} \url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Musk+%28Version+2%29}

\textbf{Description:}

The dataset contains measures of distances within different shapes (conformations) of a set of 102 molecules. The study that this data comes from used human experts to judge the smell of each molecule and determine whether it is characterized as "musk" or "non-musk", which makes this a binary classification dataset.

\subsection{Dataset Properties}

\textbf{Number of instances:} There are 6,598 conformations total.

\textbf{Number of features:} There are 166 features (not including the molecule and conformation names).

\subsection{Model-Related Properties}

We plan on using  a probabilistic logistic regression model to characterize the data. We intend to use a multi-variate normal prior on the weight vector. We plan to use feature "class" as the binary target for our probabilistic logistic regression model.
